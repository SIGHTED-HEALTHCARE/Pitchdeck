## **SIGHTED Pitch Deck**  

### **Slide 1: Title Slide**  
- **Project Name**: **S.I.G.H.T.E.D. (Secure Information Guarding Healthcare Through Encrypted Data)
**  
- **Tagline**: *“Privacy-Preserving Healthcare Data Exchange with Blockchain and Zero-Knowledge Proofs”*  
- Presented by: Lucy Low
- **Date:** Feb 9 2025
---

### **Slide 2: Vision**  
**Our Vision:** *To revolutionize healthcare data management through privacy-first, blockchain-based technology that empowers patients and streamlines collaboration between providers, radiologists, and insurers.*  
By leveraging **blockchain, Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), and federated learning**, SIGHTED provides a scalable, trustless network for real-time data sharing and verification.

### **Slide 3: The Problem – Fragmented and Vulnerable Healthcare Data**  
**Key Challenges:**  
1. **Data Fragmentation and Silos** – Medical data is scattered across disconnected systems, causing delays, inefficiencies, and errors.  
2. **Privacy Risks** – Sharing raw patient data increases the risk of breaches and makes compliance with regulations like **HIPAA** and **GDPR** difficult.  
3. **Manual Revenue Cycle Management (RCM)** – Current claim verification processes are slow, error-prone, and cost billions annually.  
4. **Lack of Patient Control** – Patients have no visibility or control over how their medical data is accessed and used.  

---

### **Slide 4: Target Audience**  
1. **Primary Care Providers (PCPs)** – Real-time access to verified patient data for better treatment outcomes.  
2. **Radiologists** – Secure, blockchain-based imaging results for collaborative care.  
3. **Insurance Companies** – Automated, blockchain-backed claims verification and fraud prevention.  
4. **Patients** – Full control over their medical data with tokenized incentives for sharing anonymized information.

### **Slide 5: The Solution – SIGHTED**  
**SIGHTED: A Privacy-Preserving Healthcare Platform**  
- **Blockchain-Powered:** Combines **Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)** with **Calimero private shards** for secure data storage and exchange.  
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs):** Enable verifiable claims without exposing sensitive data.  
- **Cross-Chain Compatibility:** Connects NEAR, ICP, and Calimero for seamless tokenized workflows.  
- **Federated Learning:** Hospitals can collaborate on AI models without data exposure.  
- **Automated Revenue Cycle Management (RCM):** Reduces administrative costs with tokenized claim processes.

---

### **Slide 6: How SIGHTED Works**  
1. **Patient-Centric Data Ownership** – Patients generate ZKPs to prove treatment eligibility without revealing raw data.  
2. **Primary Care Provider (PCP)** – Verifies diagnosis and eligibility using ZKPs from the patient.  
3. **Radiologist** – Provides imaging results with ZKP-based confirmation to the PCP.  
4. **Insurance Company** – Automates claims processing using tokenized data.  

---

### **Slide 7: Key Features**  
1. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs):** Prove eligibility or diagnosis without revealing private data.  
2. **Cross-Chain Swaps:** Easily exchange tokens between **NEAR, ICP, and Calimero** for multi-chain compatibility.  
3. **Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning:** Hospitals collaborate on AI models without sharing sensitive data.  
4. **Automated Claims Processing:** Streamline RCM processes with tokenized workflows.  

---

### **Slide 8: Competitive Landscape**  
#### **Competitors:**  
1. **Change Healthcare**: A legacy RCM solution with no blockchain integration.  
2. **MIT MedRec**: Focuses on patient-centric data but lacks ZKP-based privacy and tokenized RCM.  
3. **Owkin**: Strong AI focus but limited real-time blockchain support.  

**SIGHTED’s Unique Advantage**: Combines blockchain, ZKPs, federated learning, and cross-chain compatibility in a single solution.

---

### **Slide 9: Technical Architecture**  
1. **ICP Frontend** – Built using **Motoko** with React-based dashboards for seamless user experience.  
2. **Calimero Backend** – Manages sensitive data using **JSON-RPC API** for real-time proof verification.  
3. **Circom & snarkjs** – ZKP circuit generation and proof verification for tokenized access.  
4. **Node.js Integration** – Manages API endpoints and federated learning.

---

### **Slide 10: Business Model**  
**Revenue Streams:**  
1. **Subscription Model:** Healthcare providers and insurers pay for access to premium services.  
2. **Tokenized Incentives:** Anonymized data sharing rewards using tokens.  
3. **AI Model Licensing:** Hospitals monetize federated learning models.  
4. **Transaction Fees:** For blockchain-based claims processing.  

---

### **Slide 11: Feasibility & Scalability**  
**Why SIGHTED is Scalable:**  
- **ICP’s low-cost, scalable architecture** supports high-volume healthcare data.  
- **Calimero private shards** ensure secure and fast access to sensitive information.  
- **Cross-Chain Compatibility** opens future opportunities for integration with other blockchain networks.  

---

### **Slide 12: Real-World Impact**  
1. **Improved Patient Outcomes:** Faster diagnosis and real-time verification.  
2. **Cost Reduction:** Reduces administrative errors and processing costs.  
3. **Enhanced Privacy and Security:** Patients retain full control of their data.  
4. **Accelerated AI Innovation:** Federated learning improves medical AI models.  

---

### **Slide 13: Roadmap**  
**Phase 1 (3–6 Months):** MVP Development – ZKP for Claims & Patient Data Access  
**Phase 2 (6–12 Months):** Expand to Radiology & AI Model Collaboration  
**Phase 3 (12–18 Months):** Full-Scale RCM Integration and AI Model Licensing
